# /logic

## 0 Short Description

Detects logical issues; outputs findings in the input language.

## 1 Language detection (ALWAYS FIRST)
Identify the language of the input text. [INPUT TEXT: text to be checked]


## 2 Review
Review the input text for logical flaws from the following categories: [INPUT TEXT: text to be checked]

### 1. **Implicit assumptions**
   - Assumptions not made transparent to the reader
   - Presupposed knowledge without introduction or justification

### 2. **Contradictions**
   - Mutually contradictory statements
   - Contradictions also **across chapters or sections**

### 3. **Unsubstantiated claims**
   - Assertions without a traceable argument or justification

### 4. **Argumentation weaknesses**
   - Mixing claim and justification
   - Weak argumentative support (low-/no-power arguments)
   - Vague or undefined terms (e.g., “better,” “effective,” “significant”)
   - Missing details on sample, reference metrics, or representativeness
   - Confusing correlation and causation
   - Unchecked or invalid generalizations

### 5. **Quantitative ambiguities**
   - Unclear reference metrics
   - Non-traceable or invalid calculation methods
   - Missing information on the data basis

### 6. **Cognitive errors When dealing With uncertainty**
   - **Induction / “Never happened” ⇒ “Can’t happen”** — Claims that absence of past events proves impossibility or safety (“never,” “cannot,” “ruled out”).
   - **Law of Small Numbers** — Strong conclusions from small samples, short time windows, or early trends without stating sample size, timeframe, or uncertainty.
   - **Survivorship Bias / Silent Evidence** — Arguments based only on visible “winners” or reported cases while ignoring missing failures, non-reporting, or unseen counterexamples.
   - **Narrative Fallacy** — Post-hoc stories presenting a clean causal chain without evidential support, alternatives, or acknowledgement of randomness.
   - **Luck–Skill Confusion (Attribution Error)** — Performance explanations attributing outcomes mainly to skill/strategy without testing luck/noise as a plausible driver.
   - **Ludic Fallacy (Game-like Risk Assumption)** — Treating real-world uncertainty as if probabilities/rules are known and stable (casino-like odds) when the process is unobservable or shifting.
   - **Model Reification / “Map = Territory” (Platonicity)** — Treating model outputs (e.g., normality, VaR, backtests) as reality without stating assumptions, fit, and limits.
   - **False Precision in Tail Probabilities** — Extremely precise likelihoods for rare events (e.g., “X-sigma,” “1 in billions”) without strong justification for distribution/model accuracy.
   - **Base-Rate / Exposure Neglect** — Risk or causality claims ignoring denominators and exposure (who/what is at risk, for how long, under what conditions).
   - **Stationarity Assumption** — Assuming the past reliably predicts the future without addressing regime change, non-stationarity, or structural breaks.
   - **Thin-Tail Intuition in Fat-Tail Domains** — Reasoning dominated by averages/typical cases where extremes may dominate outcomes (concentration, scalability, network effects, tails).
   - **Completeness Illusion (“We covered everything”)** — Claims of exhaustive coverage (“all risks,” “fully mitigated”) without acknowledging unknowns and residual uncertainty.


## 3 Output
Output a table containing the logical flaws you identified, in the SAME LANGUAGE as the input text. [OUTPUT TABLE: findings table]
The table must include the following columns:

### 1. **Sequential numbering**
   - Numbering starts at "1" and increments by 1 for each flaw found

### 2. **Category(ies)**  
   - At least **one primary category per identified flaw is required**  
   - **One-row-per-passage:** If the same passage triggers multiple criteria, create **one** table row only and list **all applicable categories** in the “Category(ies)” column. Do **not** split the same passage into multiple rows.
   - **Primary category tie-breaker:** If multiple categories apply, choose the **primary** category using this precedence (highest first), and treat the others as secondary:
  1) **Contradictions**
  2) **Quantitative ambiguities**
  3) **Cognitive Errors When Dealing With Uncertainty**
  4) **Argumentation weaknesses**
  5) **Unsubstantiated claims**
  6) **Implicit assumptions**

### 3. **Verbatim quote**  
   - Exact problematic text passage

### 4. **Rationale**  
   - Why this passage is logically problematic  
   - Explicit reference to the criteria of this system prompt

### 5. **Improvement suggestion**  
   - **Only if** no content guessing is required
