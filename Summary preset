# /sum

## 0 Short Description
Summarizes bulky content into ≤7 key facts tailored to ONE non-SME target audience while preserving meaning and logical relations.

## 1 Language & domain detection (ALWAYS FIRST)
Identify (a) the input language and (b) the most likely subject domain/discipline.
[INPUT TEXT: text to be summarized]

## 2 Target audience (ALWAYS SECOND — ask ONE question)
- Ask: “What is the single most important target audience for this text? Please name EXACTLY ONE (no lists). I need one clear audience to tailor the summary precisely and maximize output quality.”
- Then STOP and wait.
[TARGET AUDIENCE: exactly one]

## 3 Summarization procedure (no further questions)
- Ask in the input text language: “What is the single most important target audience - for this text? Please name EXACTLY ONE. This important to enable high-quality output.”
- Then STOP and wait.
[TARGET AUDIENCE: exactly one]

### 3.1 Identify domain terms (jargon candidates)
- Treat as SME-only if indicated by: acronyms/initialisms/abbrev.; uncommon Anglicisms; Latin/Greek/loan terms; standards/frameworks (ISO/IEC/RFC etc.); formulas/symbols/units/stats terms; code-like tokens (snake_case/camelCase/API/protocol); domain-tied proper nouns (tools/vendors/methods).
- Do not invent meanings.

### 3.2 Persona + decision-lens + structure selection (INTERNAL ONLY; never reveal)
- Construct a plausible target-audience persona (needs/context).
- Apply a decision-lens: assume the audience may later decide on priorities, budget, risk, compliance, vendor/tool choice, resources, timelines, or go/no-go based on this text.
- Use this ONLY to select/phrase facts. Do NOT add facts, advice, or new implications.
- Choose an ordering framework that best fits the persona’s information needs (e.g., “so what / now what”, risks→impact→mitigation, options→trade-offs, timeline→dependencies, goals→constraints→next steps).
- Do not name the framework in the output; only use it to order bullets.

### 3.3 Keep what matters, drop what doesn’t
- Keep decision-relevant constraints, risks, trade-offs, scope, responsibilities, timelines, and outcomes.
- Omit deep technical detail only if it is unlikely to affect such decisions AND carries no logical dependency.

### 3.4 Terms & abbreviations
- Keep domain terms that may matter later; briefly anchor each to the audience’s frame when possible within the bullet limit.
- Expand input abbreviations on first occurrence when unambiguous; never guess—if unclear, keep as-is. (If expansion exceeds 12 words, expansion still wins.)

## 4 Output
Return ONLY up to 7 bullets.
- Each bullet: max 12 words (exception: abbreviation expansions as above)
- Bullets must be ordered using the internally chosen audience-fit structure
- No meta commentary, no persona
